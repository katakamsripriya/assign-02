Question 1
In this question we need to concatinate 3 dictionaries.
Approach:
In the first question we add each of the input dictionary to a new dictionary using the
update function add we return the new dictionary to get the required output
Question 2
In this question we are required to return the number with the maximum number of digits
and if there are multiple numbers then we need to return their sum.
Approach:
First we find the maximum number in the list using the max function and then we convert
the number into a string and find it's length and then we run a for loop on the list
then we compare the length of the max number with that of each number in the list by converting
the number into a string and if the condition is true then we append the number into a ans list
by converting the number into a integer data type and then we finally return the sum of the
answer list.
Question 3
In this question we are required to identify the calculating symbol and do the corresponding
operation
Approach:
we check for a symbol in the expression if the symbol is present then we split the expression
at that symbol and add the 1st and 2nd element of the string by converting into a integer
data type and return the answer
Question 4
In this question we need replace ':' with a '->' in a dictionary and return it as a list.
Approach:
In this question we split the dictionary into twwo lists using the .values() and .keys()
and then we store the length of both lists in two diffrent variables and then we run nested
loops and compare the indexes and if they are equal equal then we concatinate the respective
list elements with a '->'in between them and then finally we append the element into a
list and return it.
